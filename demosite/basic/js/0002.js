(CNN) — A team of deep-sea explorers and historians have discovered a Japanese aircraft carrier that sank during the historic Battle of Midway in World War II.

The wreckage of Akagi, which was sunk on June 5, 1942, during the significant four-day naval battle that killed 3,057 Japanese and 307 Americans, was located on Sunday, Vulcan Inc. said in a press release.

Crew aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned and operated by Vulcan Inc., determined the ruins belonged to Akagi by taking sonar images identified by the vessel and matching them with the dimensions and location of the lost warship.

"Every shipwreck we find reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who served their countries," said Robert Kraft, Vulcan Inc.'s director of undersea operations, in a press release. "Our team is truly honored to have discovered the Japanese Flagship Carrier, Akagi."

The ruins of Akagi were found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, resting more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the Central Pacific ocean about 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, the press release said.

The carrier was found by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, according to Vulcan. The vehicle uses a side-scan sonar which records a specific search area of the ocean floor. When the vehicle returns, the sonar data is analyzed for anomalies that could be debris or an actual wreck. Once located, the AUV is sent down again to do a high-frequency scan.

"It's been a privilege to work as part of this team during this expedition," said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command who was on the Petrel for the expedition. "I hope the discoveries we made shed new light on this pivotal battle and inspire others to study history."

Second wrecked ship found this week


This marks the second Japanese carrier from the Battle of Midway to be discovered in the past week.

The carrier Kaga discovered on October 16 was the first sunken Japanese aircraft carrier to ever be found. Kaga and Akagi are two of four Japanese fleet carriers that sunk during the battle.

"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," Thompson said. "The efforts made by the Vulcan team aboard Petrel in finding the wrecks of Kaga and Akagi will give historians a new perspective of one of World War II's pivotal battles."

The Battle of Midway took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade and capture Midway Island by luring American aircraft carriers into an ambush.

However, US cryptographers were able to intercept Japanese communications about the strike and determine when and where the Japanese were planning to attack. The US Navy was waiting for the Japanese when they arrived.

On June 4, US torpedo bombers attacked the Japanese fleet, which included four carriers, the Akagi, the Hiryu, the Kaga, and the Soryu. The initial wave of torpedo bombers was nearly wiped out, but the attack drew Japanese fighters away from the carriers.

A second wave of American dive bombers from the USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown attacked the fleet, fatally damaging the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. A third attack caught the Hiryu and inflicted major damage. The four carriers were eventually scuttled by Japanese destroyers.

The US lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown, in the battle. According to US Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command, the four Japanese carriers that sank participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese lost 100 trained pilots at Midway, who could not be replaced.

"In a larger strategic sense, the Japanese offensive in the Pacific was derailed and their plans to advance on New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa postponed. The balance of sea power in the Pacific had begun to shift," according to the naval history command's account of the battle.


Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied.

They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption, experts say.

Emsi, a company specializing in labor market research, examined the job histories of about 125 million Americans. Researchers looked at the first three jobs of graduates in six fields: languages and philosophy, social sciences, business, communications, engineering, and information technology.

The study, released last month, found that many graduates started out in the field they studied in college. For example, 20 percent of engineering graduates worked in industrial or mechanical engineering in their first job.

But by their third job, many were working in an unrelated field.

Advertising, sales and financial research were among the top 10 job outcomes, or results, for all six groups. About 54 percent of all job outcomes in the study were some form of business operations.

While the study does not look at every field, the six varied fields studied had similar outcomes, suggesting career paths have changed overall.

"A lot of the way we think about work and education … is still … like, 'The jobs are scientists and writer and teacher. … What do you want to be when you grow up?' way of thinking about jobs," said Clare Coffey, a data researcher and writer for Emsi. "But the areas where there's tons of demand and tons of growth are … being able to communicate about products for companies and also oversee the process by which they're distributed."

Coffey noted that in fields like the hard sciences, such as chemistry, it is easier to communicate to potential employers what was learned in class. For students who major in philosophy, colleges and universities need to help them promote and market their valuable skills, such as written communication and forming arguments.

Edwin Koc, director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said his daughter, who graduated from college in 2014, has held four different jobs since then. He graduated in 1973 and has held the same number of jobs since then.

Part of the reason is a strong U.S. job market, he said. If people are unhappy, it is easier to find a better-paying job. Younger workers also have less loyalty to employers.

"They've gone through growing up during a period when their parents may have found themselves … losing their jobs or at risk of losing their jobs, during the Great Recession. And they're carrying that over with them: a skepticism about what an employer will do on their behalf," said Koc.

He suggested that employers also have power in the current labor market. As technology changes, the skills a person possesses upon graduating often become outdated within six years. And employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.

Graduate students

This lack of straightforwardness in career paths does not just affect graduates of four-year degree programs, said Hironao Okahana, associate vice president for research and policy analysis from the Council of Graduate Schools.

Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer. Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise — so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.

In July, the Council of Graduate Studies released a study looking at the job outcomes for more than 4,700 Ph.D. holders. They had graduated three, eight or 15 years ago.

Few Ph.D. holders who graduated 15 years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.

This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.

'Education for the whole human'

Okahana said this means Ph.D. holders should not consider their first job permanent, or one in business as their last. It also means they might experience fields they never considered before. Because of this, they must try to develop as many useful skills in different fields as they can.

"I hope the discoveries we made shed new light on this pivotal battle and inspire others to study history."

Second wrecked ship found this week


This marks the second Japanese carrier from the Battle of Midway to be discovered in the past week.

The carrier Kaga discovered on October 16 was the first sunken Japanese aircraft carrier to ever be found. Kaga and Akagi are two of four Japanese fleet carriers that sunk during the battle.

"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," Thompson said. "The efforts made by the Vulcan team aboard Petrel in finding the wrecks of Kaga and Akagi will give historians a new perspective of one of World War II's pivotal battles."

The Battle of Midway took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade and capture Midway Island by luring American aircraft carriers into an ambush.

However, US cryptographers were able to intercept Japanese communications about the strike and determine when and where the Japanese were planning to attack. The US Navy was waiting for the Japanese when they arrived.

On June 4, US torpedo bombers attacked the Japanese fleet, which included four carriers, the Akagi, the Hiryu, the Kaga, and the Soryu. The initial wave of torpedo bombers was nearly wiped out, but the attack drew Japanese fighters away from the carriers.

A second wave of American dive bombers from the USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown attacked the fleet, fatally damaging the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. A third attack caught the Hiryu and inflicted major damage. The four carriers were eventually scuttled by Japanese destroyers.

The US lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown, in the battle. According to US Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command, the four Japanese carriers that sank participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese lost 100 trained pilots at Midway, who could not be replaced.

"In a larger strategic sense, the Japanese offensive in the Pacific was derailed and their plans to advance on New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa postponed. The balance of sea power in the Pacific had begun to shift," according to the naval history command's account of the battle.


Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied.

They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption, experts say.

Emsi, a company specializing in labor market research, examined the job histories of about 125 million Americans. Researchers looked at the first three jobs of graduates in six fields: languages and philosophy, social sciences, business, communications, engineering, and information technology.

The study, released last month, found that many graduates started out in the field they studied in college. For example, 20 percent of engineering graduates worked in industrial or mechanical engineering in their first job.

But by their third job, many were working in an unrelated field.

Advertising, sales and financial research were among the top 10 job outcomes, or results, for all six groups. About 54 percent of all job outcomes in the study were some form of business operations.

While the study does not look at every field, the six varied fields studied had similar outcomes, suggesting career paths have changed overall.

"A lot of the way we think about work and education … is still … like, 'The jobs are scientists and writer and teacher. … What do you want to be when you grow up?' way of thinking about jobs," said Clare Coffey, a data researcher and writer for Emsi. "But the areas where there's tons of demand and tons of growth are … being able to communicate about products for companies and also oversee the process by which they're distributed."

Coffey noted that in fields like the hard sciences, such as chemistry, it is easier to communicate to potential employers what was learned in class. For students who major in philosophy, colleges and universities need to help them promote and market their valuable skills, such as written communication and forming arguments.

Edwin Koc, director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said his daughter, who graduated from college in 2014, has held four different jobs since then. He graduated in 1973 and has held the same number of jobs since then.

Part of the reason is a strong U.S. job market, he said. If people are unhappy, it is easier to find a better-paying job. Younger workers also have less loyalty to employers.

"They've gone through growing up during a period when their parents may have found themselves … losing their jobs or at risk of losing their jobs, during the Great Recession. And they're carrying that over with them: a skepticism about what an employer will do on their behalf," said Koc.

He suggested that employers also have power in the current labor market. As technology changes, the skills a person possesses upon graduating often become outdated within six years. And employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.

Graduate students

This lack of straightforwardness in career paths does not just affect graduates of four-year degree programs, said Hironao Okahana, associate vice president for research and policy analysis from the Council of Graduate Schools.

Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer. Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise — so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.

In July, the Council of Graduate Studies released a study looking at the job outcomes for more than 4,700 Ph.D. holders. They had graduated three, eight or 15 years ago.

Few Ph.D. holders who graduated 15 years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.

This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.

'Education for the whole human'

Okahana said this means Ph.D. holders should not consider their first job permanent, or one in business as their last. It also means they might experience fields they never considered before. Because of this, they must try to develop as many useful skills in different fields as they can.

"Some of the … broader skills become important, which sort of points to … post-secondary education not just as a workforce development or job preparation but more … education for the whole human," he said.

Okahana, Koc and Coffey all said colleges and universities must support students in growth and change. They should urge students to take classes outside their field of study and seek out work experience in areas of interest to them. And employers should look to fill positions with individuals who might not have studied the subjects normally expected for those jobs.
(CNN) — A team of deep-sea explorers and historians have discovered a Japanese aircraft carrier that sank during the historic Battle of Midway in World War II.

The wreckage of Akagi, which was sunk on June 5, 1942, during the significant four-day naval battle that killed 3,057 Japanese and 307 Americans, was located on Sunday, Vulcan Inc. said in a press release.

Crew aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned and operated by Vulcan Inc., determined the ruins belonged to Akagi by taking sonar images identified by the vessel and matching them with the dimensions and location of the lost warship.

"Every shipwreck we find reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who served their countries," said Robert Kraft, Vulcan Inc.'s director of undersea operations, in a press release. "Our team is truly honored to have discovered the Japanese Flagship Carrier, Akagi."

The ruins of Akagi were found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, resting more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the Central Pacific ocean about 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, the press release said.

The carrier was found by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, according to Vulcan. The vehicle uses a side-scan sonar which records a specific search area of the ocean floor. When the vehicle returns, the sonar data is analyzed for anomalies that could be debris or an actual wreck. Once located, the AUV is sent down again to do a high-frequency scan.

"It's been a privilege to work as part of this team during this expedition," said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command who was on the Petrel for the expedition.

Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied.

They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption, experts say.

Emsi, a company specializing in labor market research, examined the job histories of about 125 million Americans. Researchers looked at the first three jobs of graduates in six fields: languages and philosophy, social sciences, business, communications, engineering, and information technology.

The study, released last month, found that many graduates started out in the field they studied in college. For example, 20 percent of engineering graduates worked in industrial or mechanical engineering in their first job.

But by their third job, many were working in an unrelated field.

Advertising, sales and financial research were among the top 10 job outcomes, or results, for all six groups. About 54 percent of all job outcomes in the study were some form of business operations.

While the study does not look at every field, the six varied fields studied had similar outcomes, suggesting career paths have changed overall.

"A lot of the way we think about work and education … is still … like, 'The jobs are scientists and writer and teacher. … What do you want to be when you grow up?' way of thinking about jobs," said Clare Coffey, a data researcher and writer for Emsi. "But the areas where there's tons of demand and tons of growth are … being able to communicate about products for companies and also oversee the process by which they're distributed."

Coffey noted that in fields like the hard sciences, such as chemistry, it is easier to communicate to potential employers what was learned in class. For students who major in philosophy, colleges and universities need to help them promote and market their valuable skills, such as written communication and forming arguments.

Edwin Koc, director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said his daughter, who graduated from college in 2014, has held four different jobs since then. He graduated in 1973 and has held the same number of jobs since then.

Part of the reason is a strong U.S. job market, he said. If people are unhappy, it is easier to find a better-paying job. Younger workers also have less loyalty to employers.

"They've gone through growing up during a period when their parents may have found themselves … losing their jobs or at risk of losing their jobs, during the Great Recession. And they're carrying that over with them: a skepticism about what an employer will do on their behalf," said Koc.

He suggested that employers also have power in the current labor market. As technology changes, the skills a person possesses upon graduating often become outdated within six years. And employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.

Graduate students

This lack of straightforwardness in career paths does not just affect graduates of four-year degree programs, said Hironao Okahana, associate vice president for research and policy analysis from the Council of Graduate Schools.

Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer. Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise — so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.

In July, the Council of Graduate Studies released a study looking at the job outcomes for more than 4,700 Ph.D. holders. They had graduated three, eight or 15 years ago.

Few Ph.D. holders who graduated 15 years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.

This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.

'Education for the whole human'

Okahana said this means Ph.D. holders should not consider their first job permanent, or one in business as their last. It also means they might experience fields they never considered before. Because of this, they must try to develop as many useful skills in different fields as they can.

"Some of the … broader skills become important, which sort of points to … post-secondary education not just as a workforce development or job preparation but more … education for the whole human," he said.

Okahana, Koc and Coffey all said colleges and universities must support students in growth and change. They should urge students to take classes outside their field of study and seek out work experience in areas of interest to them. And employers should look to fill positions with individuals who might not have studied the subjects normally expected for those jobs.
(CNN) — A team of deep-sea explorers and historians have discovered a Japanese aircraft carrier that sank during the historic Battle of Midway in World War II.

The wreckage of Akagi, which was sunk on June 5, 1942, during the significant four-day naval battle that killed 3,057 Japanese and 307 Americans, was located on Sunday, Vulcan Inc. said in a press release.

Crew aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned and operated by Vulcan Inc., determined the ruins belonged to Akagi by taking sonar images identified by the vessel and matching them with the dimensions and location of the lost warship.

"Every shipwreck we find reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who served their countries," said Robert Kraft, Vulcan Inc.'s director of undersea operations, in a press release. "Our team is truly honored to have discovered the Japanese Flagship Carrier, Akagi."

The ruins of Akagi were found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, resting more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the Central Pacific ocean about 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, the press release said.

The carrier was found by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, according to Vulcan. The vehicle uses a side-scan sonar which records a specific search area of the ocean floor. When the vehicle returns, the sonar data is analyzed for anomalies that could be debris or an actual wreck. Once located, the AUV is sent down again to do a high-frequency scan.

"It's been a privilege to work as part of this team during this expedition," said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command who was on the Petrel for the expedition. "I hope the discoveries we made shed new light on this pivotal battle and inspire others to study history."

Second wrecked ship found this week


This marks the second Japanese carrier from the Battle of Midway to be discovered in the past week.

The carrier Kaga discovered on October 16 was the first sunken Japanese aircraft carrier to ever be found. Kaga and Akagi are two of four Japanese fleet carriers that sunk during the battle.

"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," Thompson said. "The efforts made by the Vulcan team aboard Petrel in finding the wrecks of Kaga and Akagi will give historians a new perspective of one of World War II's pivotal battles."

The Battle of Midway took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade and capture Midway Island by luring American aircraft carriers into an ambush.

However, US cryptographers were able to intercept Japanese communications about the strike and determine when and where the Japanese were planning to attack. The US Navy was waiting for the Japanese when they arrived.

On June 4, US torpedo bombers attacked the Japanese fleet, which included four carriers, the Akagi, the Hiryu, the Kaga, and the Soryu. The initial wave of torpedo bombers was nearly wiped out, but the attack drew Japanese fighters away from the carriers.

A second wave of American dive bombers from the USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown attacked the fleet, fatally damaging the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. A third attack caught the Hiryu and inflicted major damage. The four carriers were eventually scuttled by Japanese destroyers.

The US lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown, in the battle. According to US Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command, the four Japanese carriers that sank participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese lost 100 trained pilots at Midway, who could not be replaced.

Edwin Koc, director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said his daughter, who graduated from college in 2014, has held four different jobs since then. He graduated in 1973 and has held the same number of jobs since then.

Part of the reason is a strong U.S. job market, he said. If people are unhappy, it is easier to find a better-paying job. Younger workers also have less loyalty to employers.

"They've gone through growing up during a period when their parents may have found themselves … losing their jobs or at risk of losing their jobs, during the Great Recession. And they're carrying that over with them: a skepticism about what an employer will do on their behalf," said Koc.

He suggested that employers also have power in the current labor market. As technology changes, the skills a person possesses upon graduating often become outdated within six years. And employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.

Graduate students

This lack of straightforwardness in career paths does not just affect graduates of four-year degree programs, said Hironao Okahana, associate vice president for research and policy analysis from the Council of Graduate Schools.

Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer. Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise — so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.

In July, the Council of Graduate Studies released a study looking at the job outcomes for more than 4,700 Ph.D. holders. They had graduated three, eight or 15 years ago.

Few Ph.D. holders who graduated 15 years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.

This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.

'Education for the whole human'

Okahana said this means Ph.D. holders should not consider their first job permanent, or one in business as their last. It also means they might experience fields they never considered before. Because of this, they must try to develop as many useful skills in different fields as they can.

"Some of the … broader skills become important, which sort of points to … post-secondary education not just as a workforce development or job preparation but more … education for the whole human," he said.

Okahana, Koc and Coffey all said colleges and universities must support students in growth and change. They should urge students to take classes outside their field of study and seek out work experience in areas of interest to them. And employers should look to fill positions with individuals who might not have studied the subjects normally expected for those jobs.
(CNN) — A team of deep-sea explorers and historians have discovered a Japanese aircraft carrier that sank during the historic Battle of Midway in World War II.

The wreckage of Akagi, which was sunk on June 5, 1942, during the significant four-day naval battle that killed 3,057 Japanese and 307 Americans, was located on Sunday, Vulcan Inc. said in a press release.

Crew aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned and operated by Vulcan Inc., determined the ruins belonged to Akagi by taking sonar images identified by the vessel and matching them with the dimensions and location of the lost warship.

"Every shipwreck we find reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who served their countries," said Robert Kraft, Vulcan Inc.'s director of undersea operations, in a press release. "Our team is truly honored to have discovered the Japanese Flagship Carrier, Akagi."

The ruins of Akagi were found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, resting more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the Central Pacific ocean about 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, the press release said.

The carrier was found by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, according to Vulcan. The vehicle uses a side-scan sonar which records a specific search area of the ocean floor. When the vehicle returns, the sonar data is analyzed for anomalies that could be debris or an actual wreck. Once located, the AUV is sent down again to do a high-frequency scan.

"It's been a privilege to work as part of this team during this expedition," said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command who was on the Petrel for the expedition. "I hope the discoveries we made shed new light on this pivotal battle and inspire others to study history."

Second wrecked ship found this week


This marks the second Japanese carrier from the Battle of Midway to be discovered in the past week.

The carrier Kaga discovered on October 16 was the first sunken Japanese aircraft carrier to ever be found. Kaga and Akagi are two of four Japanese fleet carriers that sunk during the battle.

"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," Thompson said. "The efforts made by the Vulcan team aboard Petrel in finding the wrecks of Kaga and Akagi will give historians a new perspective of one of World War II's pivotal battles."

The Battle of Midway took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade and capture Midway Island by luring American aircraft carriers into an ambush.

However, US cryptographers were able to intercept Japanese communications about the strike and determine when and where the Japanese were planning to attack. The US Navy was waiting for the Japanese when they arrived.

On June 4, US torpedo bombers attacked the Japanese fleet, which included four carriers, the Akagi, the Hiryu, the Kaga, and the Soryu. The initial wave of torpedo bombers was nearly wiped out, but the attack drew Japanese fighters away from the carriers.

A second wave of American dive bombers from the USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown attacked the fleet, fatally damaging the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. A third attack caught the Hiryu and inflicted major damage. The four carriers were eventually scuttled by Japanese destroyers.

The US lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown, in the battle. According to US Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command, the four Japanese carriers that sank participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese lost 100 trained pilots at Midway, who could not be replaced.

"In a larger strategic sense, the Japanese offensive in the Pacific was derailed and their plans to advance on New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa postponed. The balance of sea power in the Pacific had begun to shift," according to the naval history command's account of the battle.


Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied.

They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption, experts say.

Emsi, a company specializing in labor market research, examined the job histories of about 125 million Americans. Researchers looked at the first three jobs of graduates in six fields: languages and philosophy, social sciences, business, communications, engineering, and information technology.

The study, released last month, found that many graduates started out in the field they studied in college. For example, 20 percent of engineering graduates worked in industrial or mechanical engineering in their first job.

But by their third job, many were working in an unrelated field.

Advertising, sales and financial research were among the top 10 job outcomes, or results, for all six groups. About 54 percent of all job outcomes in the study were some form of business operations.

While the study does not look at every field, the six varied fields studied had similar outcomes, suggesting career paths have changed overall.

"A lot of the way we think about work and education … is still … like, 'The jobs are scientists and writer and teacher. … What do you want to be when you grow up?' way of thinking about jobs," said Clare Coffey, a data researcher and writer for Emsi. "But the areas where there's tons of demand and tons of growth are … being able to communicate about products for companies and also oversee the process by which they're distributed."

Coffey noted that in fields like the hard sciences, such as chemistry, it is easier to communicate to potential employers what was learned in class. For students who major in philosophy, colleges and universities need to help them promote and market their valuable skills, such as written communication and forming arguments.

Okahana said this means Ph.D. holders should not consider their first job permanent, or one in business as their last. It also means they might experience fields they never considered before. Because of this, they must try to develop as many useful skills in different fields as they can.

"Some of the … broader skills become important, which sort of points to … post-secondary education not just as a workforce development or job preparation but more … education for the whole human," he said.

Okahana, Koc and Coffey all said colleges and universities must support students in growth and change. They should urge students to take classes outside their field of study and seek out work experience in areas of interest to them. And employers should look to fill positions with individuals who might not have studied the subjects normally expected for those jobs.
(CNN) — A team of deep-sea explorers and historians have discovered a Japanese aircraft carrier that sank during the historic Battle of Midway in World War II.

The wreckage of Akagi, which was sunk on June 5, 1942, during the significant four-day naval battle that killed 3,057 Japanese and 307 Americans, was located on Sunday, Vulcan Inc. said in a press release.

Crew aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned and operated by Vulcan Inc., determined the ruins belonged to Akagi by taking sonar images identified by the vessel and matching them with the dimensions and location of the lost warship.

"Every shipwreck we find reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who served their countries," said Robert Kraft, Vulcan Inc.'s director of undersea operations, in a press release. "Our team is truly honored to have discovered the Japanese Flagship Carrier, Akagi."

The ruins of Akagi were found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, resting more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the Central Pacific ocean about 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, the press release said.

The carrier was found by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, according to Vulcan. The vehicle uses a side-scan sonar which records a specific search area of the ocean floor. When the vehicle returns, the sonar data is analyzed for anomalies that could be debris or an actual wreck. Once located, the AUV is sent down again to do a high-frequency scan.

"It's been a privilege to work as part of this team during this expedition," said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command who was on the Petrel for the expedition. "I hope the discoveries we made shed new light on this pivotal battle and inspire others to study history."

Second wrecked ship found this week


This marks the second Japanese carrier from the Battle of Midway to be discovered in the past week.

The carrier Kaga discovered on October 16 was the first sunken Japanese aircraft carrier to ever be found. Kaga and Akagi are two of four Japanese fleet carriers that sunk during the battle.

"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," Thompson said. "The efforts made by the Vulcan team aboard Petrel in finding the wrecks of Kaga and Akagi will give historians a new perspective of one of World War II's pivotal battles."

The Battle of Midway took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade and capture Midway Island by luring American aircraft carriers into an ambush.

However, US cryptographers were able to intercept Japanese communications about the strike and determine when and where the Japanese were planning to attack. The US Navy was waiting for the Japanese when they arrived.

On June 4, US torpedo bombers attacked the Japanese fleet, which included four carriers, the Akagi, the Hiryu, the Kaga, and the Soryu. The initial wave of torpedo bombers was nearly wiped out, but the attack drew Japanese fighters away from the carriers.

A second wave of American dive bombers from the USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown attacked the fleet, fatally damaging the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. A third attack caught the Hiryu and inflicted major damage. The four carriers were eventually scuttled by Japanese destroyers.

The US lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown, in the battle. According to US Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command, the four Japanese carriers that sank participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese lost 100 trained pilots at Midway, who could not be replaced.

"In a larger strategic sense, the Japanese offensive in the Pacific was derailed and their plans to advance on New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa postponed. The balance of sea power in the Pacific had begun to shift," according to the naval history command's account of the battle.


Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied.

They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption, experts say.

Emsi, a company specializing in labor market research, examined the job histories of about 125 million Americans. Researchers looked at the first three jobs of graduates in six fields: languages and philosophy, social sciences, business, communications, engineering, and information technology.

The study, released last month, found that many graduates started out in the field they studied in college. For example, 20 percent of engineering graduates worked in industrial or mechanical engineering in their first job.

But by their third job, many were working in an unrelated field.

Advertising, sales and financial research were among the top 10 job outcomes, or results, for all six groups. About 54 percent of all job outcomes in the study were some form of business operations.

While the study does not look at every field, the six varied fields studied had similar outcomes, suggesting career paths have changed overall.

"A lot of the way we think about work and education … is still … like, 'The jobs are scientists and writer and teacher. … What do you want to be when you grow up?' way of thinking about jobs," said Clare Coffey, a data researcher and writer for Emsi. "But the areas where there's tons of demand and tons of growth are … being able to communicate about products for companies and also oversee the process by which they're distributed."

Coffey noted that in fields like the hard sciences, such as chemistry, it is easier to communicate to potential employers what was learned in class. For students who major in philosophy, colleges and universities need to help them promote and market their valuable skills, such as written communication and forming arguments.

Edwin Koc, director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said his daughter, who graduated from college in 2014, has held four different jobs since then. He graduated in 1973 and has held the same number of jobs since then.

Part of the reason is a strong U.S. job market, he said. If people are unhappy, it is easier to find a better-paying job. Younger workers also have less loyalty to employers.

"They've gone through growing up during a period when their parents may have found themselves … losing their jobs or at risk of losing their jobs, during the Great Recession. And they're carrying that over with them: a skepticism about what an employer will do on their behalf," said Koc.

He suggested that employers also have power in the current labor market. As technology changes, the skills a person possesses upon graduating often become outdated within six years. And employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.

Graduate students

This lack of straightforwardness in career paths does not just affect graduates of four-year degree programs, said Hironao Okahana, associate vice president for research and policy analysis from the Council of Graduate Schools.

Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer. Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise — so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.

In July, the Council of Graduate Studies released a study looking at the job outcomes for more than 4,700 Ph.D. holders. They had graduated three, eight or 15 years ago.

Few Ph.D. holders who graduated 15 years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.

This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.
